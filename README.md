# Introduction

This folder contains the computer code that was used to perform the numerical experiments presented in the paper

**I. L. Semenov, "A spectral element method for modelling streamer discharges in low-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasmas"**

The code is written in the Python programming language (Python 2.7.16 was used).

**Overview of the subfolders:**
 - **streamer_btest_S0** - the code used for the simulation S0 described in Section 4.1.
 - **streamer_btest_S1** - the code used for the simulation S1 described in Section 4.1
 - **streamer_btest_S2** - the code used for the simulation S2 described in Section 4.1
 - **streamer_btest_S3** - the code used for the simulation S3 described in Section 4.1
 - **streamer_btest_S4** - the code used for the simulation S4 described in Section 4.1
