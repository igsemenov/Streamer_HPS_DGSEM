# Introduction

This folder contains the scripts used to test the HPS solver.

The corresponding results are presented in the **Appendix C. Validation of the HPS solver**.

In these experiments, the Poisson equation (C.1) was solved.

In particular, this folder contains the scripts used in the computations with **alpha=1** (problem with axial symmetry).
